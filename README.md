# Iris-Classification

To write a matlab program that takes the Iris Data Set and goes through 10 iterations, 
for each iteration there is a different training and test data set. The output is that for each iteration, 
it shows the accuracy rate and after the 10 iterations is shows the average accuracy of the 10 iterations.
